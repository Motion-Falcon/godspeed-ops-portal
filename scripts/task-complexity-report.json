      "taskTitle": "Implement Jobseeker Profile Creation with Security Measures",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the jobseeker profile creation flow into subtasks covering: multi-step form implementation with progressive disclosure, field validation with React Hook Form and Zod, save-as-draft with Supabase, file upload and validation, post-submission verification workflow, AES-256 encryption for sensitive fields, audit logging and input sanitization, and conditional routing based on verification status.",
      "reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to its multi-step form with progressive disclosure, strict field validation, save-as-draft and progress tracking, secure file uploads, post-submission workflow, and extensive security requirements including encryption, audit logging, and input sanitization. Each of these areas requires careful design and implementation to ensure both usability and compliance with security standards."

      "taskTitle": "Develop Position Creation and Management with Security Controls",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the position management system into subtasks for: position creation form with validation, client data auto-fill, lifecycle status management, editing and duplication features, bulk actions, compensation calculations, draft saving, access controls, encryption of sensitive data, and audit logging.",
      "reasoning": "This task is complex due to the breadth of form fields, dynamic data dependencies, lifecycle management, bulk actions, and the need for robust security and audit logging. The integration with client data and compensation calculations further increases the implementation challenge."
