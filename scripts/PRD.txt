# Godspeed Recruitment Platform: Product Requirements Document

## Overview  
The Godspeed Recruitment Platform addresses the challenge of efficiently connecting low-level workers (drivers, forklift operators, warehouse staff) with appropriate job opportunities. The current recruitment process for these roles is often manual, time-consuming, and lacks proper matching between candidate qualifications and job requirements.

The platform serves two primary user groups:
1. **Jobseekers** - Individuals with specialized skills/licenses seeking employment
2. **Recruiters** - Staffing professionals managing the hiring process

By centralizing the recruitment workflow, automating document verification, and implementing intelligent matching algorithms, Godspeed creates value through:
- Reduced time-to-hire
