# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Timesheet Creation and Submission Workflow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core timesheet entry interface and submission process, allowing users to record work hours, differentiate between regular and overtime hours, and submit for approval.
# Details:
Create a responsive timesheet interface with the following components:

1. **Timesheet Entry Interface**:
   - Implement a weekly calendar view with daily hour entry fields
   - Create input fields for regular hours and overtime hours with validation
   - Add project/task selection dropdown connected to position data
   - Include description/notes field for each time entry
   - Implement running totals for daily and weekly hours

2. **Submission Workflow**:
   - Create a digital signature mechanism (e-signature or checkbox confirmation)
   - Implement file upload functionality for supporting documents (receipts, work evidence)
   - Add save draft functionality to allow partial completion
   - Include a submission confirmation dialog with summary
   - Store submission timestamp and user information

3. **User Experience**:
   - Implement form validation for required fields and logical hour entries
   - Create intuitive navigation between days/weeks
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for efficient data entry
   - Implement autosave functionality to prevent data loss

Technical Requirements:
- Use React components for the frontend interface
- Implement proper state management for form data
- Create RESTful API endpoints for saving/retrieving timesheet data
- Ensure database schema supports all required fields and relationships
- Integrate with existing position data from Task #3
- Follow application security standards including input validation
- Implement comprehensive error handling and user feedback

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test validation logic for hour entries (negative values, exceeding daily limits)
   - Verify calculation of daily and weekly totals
   - Test save/load functionality for draft timesheets
   - Verify file upload functionality with various file types and sizes

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test complete submission workflow from creation to final submission
   - Verify integration with position data from existing systems
   - Test persistence of all timesheet data to the database
   - Verify proper handling of concurrent edits

3. **User Acceptance Testing**:
   - Create test scenarios for different timesheet patterns (regular week, overtime, partial days)
   - Test across different devices and screen sizes
   - Verify accessibility compliance
   - Test keyboard navigation and shortcuts

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure load time for timesheet interface
   - Test system performance with large attachments
   - Verify response times when saving large timesheets

5. **Security Testing**:
   - Verify proper access controls for timesheet data
   - Test for common vulnerabilities in file upload functionality
   - Ensure sensitive timesheet data is properly protected
