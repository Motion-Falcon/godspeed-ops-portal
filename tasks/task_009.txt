# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Secure Notification System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 6
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop the email notification system for critical touchpoints in the recruitment process, with appropriate security measures for handling sensitive communication.
# Details:
Create a notification service that sends email alerts for critical events: account verification, profile submission/approval, job matching and selection, application status changes, document verification updates. Implement email templates for each notification type. Create a notification queue system to handle high volume. Add tracking for email delivery status. Integrate with the existing authentication system for user email verification. Use a reliable email delivery service compatible with the Express.js backend.

Security Considerations:
- Ensure email templates do not contain sensitive personal information
- Implement proper authentication for email verification links
- Create audit logs for all notification events
- Use secure email delivery protocols (TLS)
- Implement rate limiting for email sending to prevent abuse
- Follow the security guidelines from task 11 for handling communication data
- Ensure email tracking does not compromise user privacy

# Test Strategy:
Test email delivery for each notification type. Verify templates render correctly with dynamic content. Test the notification queue under load. Validate email tracking functionality. Ensure all critical touchpoints trigger appropriate notifications. Test email delivery to various email providers. Verify that email templates do not contain sensitive personal information. Test authentication for email verification links. Verify audit logs are created for all notification events. Test rate limiting for email sending to prevent abuse.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Email Templates and Notification Service Foundation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the core notification service structure and create secure email templates for all required notification types
### Details:
Implement a notification service module that will handle all email communications. Create HTML/text email templates for each notification type (account verification, profile submission/approval, job matching, application status changes, document verification). Ensure templates follow security best practices by not embedding sensitive personal information directly in emails. Instead, use secure links to authenticated portal views. Implement template rendering with a secure templating engine (like Handlebars or EJS) that prevents injection attacks. Set up integration with a reliable email delivery service that supports TLS (like SendGrid, Mailgun, or AWS SES) and configure proper authentication for the service.

## 2. Implement Notification Queue and Delivery System [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Build a robust queue system to handle high-volume email notifications with delivery tracking
### Details:
Develop a notification queue system using a message broker (like Redis, RabbitMQ, or Bull) to handle high volumes of notifications. Implement retry logic for failed delivery attempts. Create a delivery status tracking system that records send attempts, delivery confirmations, and bounces without compromising user privacy. Implement rate limiting for email sending to prevent abuse (configure per-user and global rate limits). Set up a scheduled job to process the notification queue at appropriate intervals. Ensure the queue system is resilient to service restarts and can recover from failures. Add monitoring for queue health and delivery success rates.

## 3. Integrate Authentication and Security Measures [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Connect the notification system with authentication and implement security features for email communications
### Details:
Integrate the notification service with the existing authentication system. Implement secure token generation for email verification links with appropriate expiration times. Create signed URLs for any action links in emails using JWT or similar technology. Implement proper validation of email verification tokens when users click links. Set up TLS for all email communications. Create a mechanism to verify email addresses before sending sensitive notifications. Implement IP-based and user-based rate limiting for verification requests. Add CSRF protection for any forms linked from emails. Ensure all email-related endpoints are properly authenticated and authorized.

## 4. Implement Audit Logging and Privacy Controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Add comprehensive audit logging for notification events and ensure privacy compliance
### Details:
Create a detailed audit logging system that records all notification events (creation, queuing, sending, delivery status) with appropriate metadata but without storing sensitive content. Implement log rotation and retention policies compliant with data protection regulations. Add admin interfaces to view notification logs with appropriate access controls. Implement privacy controls that allow users to manage their notification preferences. Create a mechanism to purge notification data according to retention policies. Set up alerts for unusual notification patterns that might indicate abuse. Develop testing procedures to verify the security of the entire notification pipeline. Document the security measures implemented for the notification system for compliance purposes.
