# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Jobseeker Profile Management and Editing Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a profile management section in the jobseeker dashboard that displays all user information and allows controlled editing with time restrictions, history tracking, and proper audit trails.
# Details:
Develop a comprehensive profile management system with the following components:

1. Profile Display Section:
   - Create a dedicated section in the jobseeker dashboard to display all user profile information
   - Organize information in logical categories matching the profile creation flow
   - Include visual indicators for verified/unverified information
   - Display last edit date and next available edit date prominently

2. Profile Editing Functionality:
   - Implement an 'Edit Profile' button that is enabled/disabled based on edit restrictions
   - Create a time-based restriction system allowing edits once per month
   - Store the restriction period in a configurable setting (default: 30 days)
   - Pre-populate edit forms with existing profile data
   - Implement form validation consistent with profile creation
   - Create a confirmation dialog before submitting changes

3. Edit History and Audit System:
   - Create a database structure to maintain full edit history
   - Store previous values, new values, timestamp, and edit reason for each change
   - Implement a system flag to mark profiles that require re-verification after edits
   - Make re-verification requirement configurable by admin
   - Create an admin-viewable audit log of all profile changes

4. Integration Requirements:
   - Connect to existing security system for proper authentication
   - Implement comprehensive logging of all profile view and edit actions
   - Ensure proper encryption of sensitive data during display and editing
   - Maintain consistent UI/UX with the existing dashboard design

Technical Considerations:
- Use the existing profile data model from the profile creation system
- Implement proper state management to handle form data during editing
- Create database triggers or hooks to update 'last_edited' and 'next_edit_date' fields
- Ensure responsive design for all profile management screens

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify all functional requirements and edge cases:

1. Display Testing:
   - Verify all profile fields are correctly displayed in the profile section
   - Confirm proper formatting of dates, currency values, and other special field types
   - Test responsive design across multiple device sizes

2. Edit Restriction Testing:
   - Verify users cannot edit profiles more frequently than the configured time period
   - Test that the edit button is properly enabled/disabled based on time restrictions
   - Confirm accurate display of next available edit date
   - Test admin override of edit restrictions

3. Edit Functionality Testing:
   - Verify all form fields are correctly pre-populated with existing data
   - Test validation of all edited fields
   - Confirm proper handling of partial edits and form submission
   - Verify confirmation dialog appears and functions correctly
   - Test cancellation of edit process returns to view mode without changes

4. History and Audit Testing:
   - Verify all edits are properly recorded in history with correct before/after values
   - Test that timestamps and user information are accurately logged
   - Confirm re-verification flags are set correctly based on configuration
   - Verify audit logs are complete and accessible to admins

5. Security Testing:
   - Test that unauthorized users cannot access profile editing
   - Verify proper encryption of sensitive data during display and transmission
   - Confirm all actions are properly logged for security audit
   - Test against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, etc.)

6. Integration Testing:
   - Verify seamless integration with existing dashboard UI
   - Test interaction with notification system for edit confirmations
   - Confirm proper functioning of the re-verification workflow if triggered

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Profile Display Section in Jobseeker Dashboard [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a dedicated section in the jobseeker dashboard that displays all user profile information in organized categories with visual indicators for verification status and edit dates.
### Details:
Implement a read-only profile view component that: 1) Fetches and displays all user profile data from the existing profile data model, 2) Organizes information into logical categories matching the profile creation flow (personal details, education, experience, skills, etc.), 3) Adds visual indicators (icons/badges) for verified vs. unverified information, 4) Shows last edit date and next available edit date prominently at the top of the profile, 5) Ensures responsive design for all screen sizes, and 6) Maintains UI/UX consistency with the existing dashboard design.

## 2. Implement Edit Restriction System and Database Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Create the database structure and backend logic to support profile editing with time-based restrictions and audit history tracking.
### Details:
Extend the existing profile data model to include: 1) 'last_edited' and 'next_edit_date' fields, 2) Create a configurable setting for the restriction period (default: 30 days), 3) Develop database triggers or hooks to automatically update these fields when edits occur, 4) Create a separate 'profile_edit_history' table to store previous values, new values, timestamps, edit reasons, and user IDs for each change, 5) Add a system flag to mark profiles requiring re-verification after edits, and 6) Implement backend logic to check edit eligibility based on the time restriction.

## 3. Build Profile Editing UI Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Develop the user interface components for profile editing, including edit forms, validation, and confirmation dialogs.
### Details:
Create UI components that: 1) Add an 'Edit Profile' button that is enabled/disabled based on time restrictions, 2) Implement edit forms for each profile section, pre-populated with existing data, 3) Apply the same validation rules used in profile creation, 4) Create a confirmation dialog that shows a summary of changes before submission, 5) Include a required field for 'reason for edit', 6) Add clear visual feedback when edits are not allowed due to time restrictions, showing when editing will be available again, and 7) Ensure all forms maintain responsive design and accessibility standards.

## 4. Implement Profile Edit Submission and Processing Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2, 12.3
### Description: Develop the backend logic to process profile edit submissions, update the database, and maintain the audit trail.
### Details:
Implement backend functionality that: 1) Validates incoming edit requests against time-based restrictions, 2) Processes form submissions and validates data integrity, 3) Stores the previous profile state in the edit history table before applying changes, 4) Updates the main profile with new information, 5) Recalculates the next available edit date, 6) Sets re-verification flags based on admin configuration, 7) Implements comprehensive logging of all edit actions, and 8) Ensures proper encryption of sensitive data during processing.

## 5. Create Admin Audit Interface and Integrate Security Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.4
### Description: Develop an admin-viewable audit log for profile changes and integrate the profile management system with existing security features.
### Details:
Complete the implementation by: 1) Creating an admin interface to view the complete edit history for any user profile, 2) Adding filtering and search capabilities to the audit log, 3) Implementing admin controls for configuring re-verification requirements and edit restriction periods, 4) Integrating with the existing authentication system to ensure proper access control, 5) Adding comprehensive security logging for all profile view and edit actions, 6) Testing the entire system for security vulnerabilities, and 7) Ensuring all sensitive data remains encrypted during display, editing, and storage.
