# Task ID: 2
# Title: Build Secure Document Upload and Storage System
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a document upload system for credential verification that handles file uploads, storage, and basic metadata tracking with appropriate security measures for sensitive documents.
# Details:
Implement a document upload component that supports multiple file types (PDF, JPG, PNG) with file size validation. Use Supabase storage for file management with proper encryption. Create a document metadata model that tracks: file type, upload date, verification status, expiration date (if applicable), and association with jobseeker profile. Implement a basic document listing interface that shows uploaded documents and their status. Add functionality to delete or replace documents.

Security Considerations:
- Implement server-side validation of file types to prevent malicious uploads
- Scan uploaded files for malware before storage
- Encrypt sensitive documents at rest using AES-256
- Implement secure access controls for document retrieval
- Create comprehensive audit logs for all document operations
- Use signed URLs with short expiration times for document access
- Implement proper logging with PII masking for document operations
- Follow the security guidelines from task 11 for document handling

# Test Strategy:
Test file upload with various file types and sizes. Verify proper storage in Supabase. Test metadata creation and association with user profiles. Ensure proper error handling for failed uploads and invalid file types. Verify document listing and management functionality. Test encryption/decryption of documents to ensure they are properly protected. Verify audit logs are created for all document operations. Test for security vulnerabilities including file type spoofing and path traversal attacks. Validate that malware scanning is functioning correctly. Test document access controls to ensure only authorized users can access specific documents.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Document Metadata Model and Database Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the database schema for document metadata tracking with proper relationships to user profiles
### Details:
Create a document metadata model in the database that includes fields for: file type, original filename, storage path, upload date, verification status, expiration date, and association with jobseeker profile. Set up appropriate indexes and constraints. Implement database-level access controls and encryption configurations for the document metadata. Create migration scripts for the new tables and relationships.

## 2. Implement Secure File Upload Component with Validation [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Build a frontend component for file uploads with client-side validation and a secure backend endpoint for receiving files
### Details:
Create a React component that allows users to select and upload documents with drag-and-drop support. Implement client-side validation for file types (PDF, JPG, PNG) and size limits (suggest 10MB max). Build a secure API endpoint that receives files, performs server-side validation of file types and sizes, generates a unique filename, and prepares for storage. Implement CSRF protection and proper authentication checks on the endpoint. Return appropriate error messages for invalid files.

## 3. Implement File Security Processing and Storage Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Create a secure pipeline for processing uploaded files including malware scanning and encryption before storage
### Details:
Integrate with a malware scanning service (like ClamAV) to check files before storage. Implement AES-256 encryption for files before uploading to Supabase storage. Create a file processing queue to handle these operations asynchronously if needed. Set up proper error handling and retry mechanisms. Configure Supabase storage buckets with appropriate access policies. Implement comprehensive logging with PII masking for all file operations. Ensure temporary files are securely deleted after processing.

## 4. Build Document Listing and Management Interface [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.3
### Description: Create a user interface to display uploaded documents with their metadata and status
### Details:
Implement a React component that lists all documents uploaded by the user, showing file type, name, upload date, verification status, and expiration date. Add filtering and sorting capabilities. Include document thumbnails where applicable. Implement proper loading states and error handling. Ensure the interface is accessible and responsive. Add pagination if supporting large numbers of documents.

## 5. Implement Secure Document Retrieval and Viewing [done]
### Dependencies: 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Create a secure system for retrieving and viewing uploaded documents with proper access controls
### Details:
Implement an API endpoint that generates short-lived signed URLs for document access. Create a document viewer component that works with different file types. Implement access control checks to ensure users can only access their own documents or documents they have permission to view. Add watermarking for sensitive documents if required. Implement audit logging for all document access events. Create a caching strategy that balances performance with security.

## 6. Add Document Management Operations and Audit Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.4, 2.5
### Description: Implement functionality to delete, replace, and manage documents with comprehensive audit logging
### Details:
Create API endpoints and UI components for deleting and replacing documents. Implement soft deletion to maintain audit records. For document replacement, maintain version history if appropriate. Create comprehensive audit logs for all document operations (upload, view, delete, replace) with appropriate user information and timestamps. Implement a secure cleanup process for deleted documents that ensures proper removal from storage. Add confirmation dialogs for destructive operations. Ensure all operations maintain the integrity of the document metadata model.
