# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Security and Logging Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and integrate a comprehensive security and logging infrastructure that includes encryption, logging, monitoring, and audit trails to protect sensitive recruitment data.
# Details:
Implement a multi-layered security and logging system with the following components:

1. API Encryption/Decryption Layer:
   - Implement TLS 1.3 for all API communications
   - Create data encryption utilities for PII and sensitive candidate information using AES-256
   - Develop secure key management system with proper rotation policies
   - Implement JWTs with appropriate expiration for authentication

2. Comprehensive Logging System:
   - Create a centralized logging service that captures events across all application components
   - Implement structured logging with consistent format (timestamp, severity, component, message, context)
   - Include different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL)
   - Ensure PII is properly masked in logs
   - Implement log rotation and retention policies

3. Security Monitoring and Threat Detection:
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
   - Create IP-based blocking for suspicious activity
   - Develop real-time alerts for security events (failed logins, permission violations)
   - Implement OWASP recommended security headers
   - Create dashboard for security event visualization

4. Audit Trails:
   - Track all CRUD operations on sensitive data (candidate profiles, interview feedback)
   - Record user actions with timestamps and IP addresses
   - Implement non-repudiation mechanisms
   - Create audit log viewer for administrators with filtering capabilities
   - Ensure audit logs are tamper-evident

The implementation should integrate with the existing authentication system and administrator functionality. All security measures should follow OWASP guidelines and GDPR/CCPA compliance requirements.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both functionality and security aspects:

1. API Encryption Testing:
   - Verify TLS implementation using tools like SSL Labs
   - Test encryption/decryption functions with various data types and sizes
   - Validate key rotation doesn't break existing encrypted data
   - Perform penetration testing to verify encryption cannot be bypassed

2. Logging System Testing:
   - Verify logs are generated for all critical operations
   - Confirm PII masking works correctly in logs
   - Test log rotation under high volume
   - Validate logs contain all required fields
   - Verify logs are properly stored and retrievable

3. Security Monitoring Testing:
   - Simulate attack scenarios (brute force, injection attempts)
   - Verify alerts are triggered appropriately
   - Test rate limiting functionality
   - Validate IP blocking mechanisms
   - Confirm security headers are properly implemented

4. Audit Trail Testing:
   - Verify all sensitive operations are recorded
   - Test audit log retrieval and filtering
   - Validate audit logs cannot be modified
   - Test performance under high audit volume
   - Verify compliance with regulatory requirements

Additionally, conduct a full security assessment including:
- Static code analysis using tools like SonarQube
- Dynamic application security testing
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Load testing to ensure security measures don't impact performance

All tests should be automated where possible and included in the CI/CD pipeline.
