# Task ID: 8
# Title: Develop Recruiter Dashboard with Security Controls
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build the recruiter dashboard showing position management, candidate matching, and document verification queues, with appropriate security measures and access controls.
# Details:
Create a comprehensive dashboard for recruiters with sections for: position management (create, edit, view status), candidate matching (view matched candidates for positions), document verification queue, and client management. Implement filtering and sorting for all sections. Add quick actions for common tasks. Create detailed views for positions, candidates, and documents. Use React for the frontend and Supabase for data retrieval.

Security Considerations:
- Implement role-based access controls for different dashboard sections
- Create comprehensive audit logs for all recruiter actions
- Ensure sensitive candidate and client data is properly protected
- Implement proper session management with inactivity timeout
- Add CSRF protection for all form submissions
- Follow the security guidelines from task 11 for handling sensitive recruitment data
- Implement data masking for sensitive information in displays

Follow the existing UI framework for design consistency.

# Test Strategy:
Test the dashboard with various recruiter scenarios. Verify all sections display correct information. Test filtering and sorting functionality. Validate quick actions perform as expected. Ensure the UI is responsive and follows the established design patterns. Test navigation between detailed views. Test role-based access controls to verify only authorized users can access specific dashboard sections. Verify audit logs are created for all recruiter actions. Test for common security vulnerabilities including XSS and CSRF attacks. Validate that sensitive data is properly masked in displays.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Core Dashboard Structure with Position Management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational dashboard layout and implement the position management section with CRUD operations and security controls.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Set up the basic dashboard layout with navigation, header, and content areas using React components
2. Create the position management section with:
   - List view of positions with filtering and sorting options
   - Create/edit position forms with validation
   - Position detail view with status information
   - Quick action buttons for common tasks
3. Implement initial security measures:
   - Set up role-based access control structure for the dashboard
   - Add CSRF protection for all position management forms
   - Implement initial audit logging for position-related actions

Testing approach:
- Unit test React components for rendering and state management
- Test CRUD operations against Supabase
- Verify role-based access controls work correctly for position management
- Test audit logging functionality for position actions
- Ensure CSRF protection is working for all forms

## 2. Develop Candidate Matching and Document Verification Sections [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Build the candidate matching and document verification queue sections with appropriate data masking and security controls.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create the candidate matching section:
   - Implement view for matched candidates per position
   - Add filtering and sorting capabilities
   - Create detailed candidate view with masked sensitive information
   - Implement quick actions for candidate processing
2. Build the document verification queue:
   - Create list view of documents pending verification
   - Implement document preview functionality
   - Add verification action buttons and status updates
   - Set up document approval workflow
3. Implement security measures for these sections:
   - Apply data masking for sensitive candidate information
   - Extend role-based access controls to these sections
   - Add audit logging for candidate and document actions
   - Implement proper error handling for sensitive operations

Testing approach:
- Test candidate matching algorithms and filtering
- Verify document queue functionality and state transitions
- Ensure sensitive data is properly masked in all views
- Test role-based access controls for different user types
- Verify audit logs capture all relevant actions

## 3. Implement Client Management and Comprehensive Security Controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Add client management functionality and implement comprehensive security measures across the entire dashboard.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Develop the client management section:
   - Create client listing with filtering and sorting
   - Implement client detail view with associated positions
   - Add client communication history and tracking
   - Create client relationship management tools
2. Implement comprehensive security measures across the dashboard:
   - Complete session management with inactivity timeout
   - Add comprehensive audit logging for all dashboard actions
   - Implement final role-based access controls for all sections
   - Set up data masking for all sensitive information
   - Add security headers and response sanitization
3. Perform integration and security testing:
   - Test interactions between all dashboard sections
   - Verify all security controls work together properly
   - Conduct security review against requirements

Testing approach:
- Test client management functionality end-to-end
- Verify session timeout and re-authentication works correctly
- Test comprehensive audit logging across all dashboard actions
- Conduct security testing for access controls and data protection
- Perform integration testing across all dashboard sections
- Verify all security requirements are met through manual testing
