# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Document Verification Center with Security Compliance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the document verification workflow including manual review interface and status tracking, with appropriate security measures for handling sensitive identity documents.
# Details:
Build a document verification center for recruiters with a queue of pending documents. Implement a document review interface showing document details and preview. Create verification workflow with approval, rejection, and information request options. Add standardized rejection categories and feedback mechanisms. Implement verification history and audit trail. For this phase, focus on manual verification (AI-assisted verification will be added in a future phase). Use Supabase for data storage and status tracking.

Security Considerations:
- Implement strict access controls for document verification
- Create comprehensive audit logs for all verification actions
- Ensure document previews are served via secure, time-limited URLs
- Implement secure document rendering that prevents download of original files
- Add watermarking for document previews to prevent unauthorized use
- Follow the security guidelines from task 11 for handling sensitive identity documents
- Implement proper logging with PII masking for verification operations

# Test Strategy:
Test the document review interface with various document types. Verify the approval, rejection, and information request workflows. Test the audit trail to ensure all actions are properly logged. Validate that feedback is correctly associated with rejected documents. Test the notification system for status changes. Test access controls to verify only authorized users can access document verification. Verify audit logs are created for all verification operations. Test security of document previews to ensure they cannot be easily downloaded or copied. Validate that document watermarking is functioning correctly. Test for security vulnerabilities in the document verification workflow.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Document Verification Database Schema and Access Controls [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the database schema for document verification workflow with proper access controls and security measures
### Details:
Using Supabase, create tables for: documents (with metadata, status, and secure URL fields), verification_history (for audit trail), verification_feedback (for rejection reasons and comments), and verification_access_logs. Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure only authorized recruiters can access documents. Create database functions for secure document operations. Set up proper indexes for efficient querying. Implement database triggers to automatically generate audit logs for all document status changes. Ensure PII fields are properly encrypted at rest.

## 2. Implement Secure Document Preview and Rendering System [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Build a secure document preview system that prevents unauthorized access and downloads while maintaining usability
### Details:
Create a service to generate time-limited, signed URLs for document access. Implement a secure document viewer component that prevents download of original files and disables browser features like print and save. Add dynamic watermarking to document previews with viewer information and timestamp. Create a document rendering pipeline that converts uploaded documents to a secure format (e.g., watermarked PDFs or images). Implement caching mechanisms for rendered documents with appropriate TTL. Ensure all document access is logged with masked PII information.

## 3. Build Document Verification Queue and Review Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Create the main verification queue and detailed document review interface for recruiters
### Details:
Develop a paginated and filterable queue interface showing pending documents with key metadata. Implement the document review interface displaying document details, secure preview, and verification options. Create UI components for document approval, rejection (with standardized categories), and information requests. Add functionality to zoom, rotate, and navigate multi-page documents. Implement real-time status updates using Supabase subscriptions. Ensure all user actions in the interface are properly logged with appropriate PII masking. Add keyboard shortcuts for common verification actions to improve efficiency.

## 4. Implement Verification Workflow and Status Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Build the complete verification workflow with status transitions and notifications
### Details:
Implement the verification state machine with states: pending, approved, rejected, and information_requested. Create workflow actions for each possible state transition with appropriate validation. Build notification system to alert users of verification status changes. Implement verification history view showing all actions taken on a document with timestamps and actor information. Create dashboard widgets showing verification metrics and queue status. Add functionality to bulk process similar documents when appropriate. Ensure all state transitions are properly logged in the audit trail.

## 5. Implement Comprehensive Audit Logging and Security Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Create detailed audit logging system and security monitoring for the verification center
### Details:
Implement comprehensive audit logging capturing all user actions, document access events, and state changes. Create an admin interface to review audit logs with filtering and search capabilities. Implement anomaly detection for suspicious verification patterns (e.g., unusual verification volume, odd-hour access). Add session tracking to detect and prevent unauthorized access attempts. Create regular security reports summarizing verification activities. Implement document access reports showing who viewed which documents and when. Ensure all logs properly mask PII data while maintaining usefulness for security monitoring. Add functionality to export audit logs for compliance purposes.
