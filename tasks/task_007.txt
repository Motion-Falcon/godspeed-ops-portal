# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Jobseeker Dashboard with Privacy Protection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the jobseeker dashboard interface showing matched positions, application status, and profile management, with appropriate security measures for personal data protection.
# Details:
Develop a dashboard for jobseekers that displays: matched positions with match percentage, application status tracking (accepted, rejected, ongoing), and profile management options. Implement filtering and sorting for matched positions. Create a detailed view for each position showing all relevant information. Add functionality to apply for positions directly from the dashboard. Use React for the frontend and Supabase for data retrieval.

Security Considerations:
- Implement proper authentication and session management
- Create audit logs for all dashboard activities
- Ensure personal data is properly protected and encrypted
- Implement rate limiting for dashboard APIs
- Add CSRF protection for all form submissions
- Follow the security guidelines from task 11 for handling personal data
- Ensure proper input validation for all user inputs

Follow the existing UI framework for design consistency.

# Test Strategy:
Test the dashboard with various user profiles and match scenarios. Verify filtering and sorting functionality. Test the application process from the dashboard. Ensure the UI is responsive and follows the established design patterns. Validate that match percentages and application statuses are correctly displayed. Test authentication and session management to ensure security. Verify audit logs are created for all dashboard activities. Test for common security vulnerabilities including XSS and CSRF attacks. Validate that personal data is properly protected and encrypted.
