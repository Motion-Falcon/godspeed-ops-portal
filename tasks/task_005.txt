# Task ID: 5
# Title: Build Candidate Matching System with Privacy Controls
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the intelligent matching algorithm that connects jobseekers with appropriate positions based on primary and secondary criteria, ensuring proper data protection and privacy.
# Details:
Implement a matching algorithm that evaluates jobseekers against positions using: Primary criteria (70% weight): License type, experience level, availability; Secondary criteria (30% weight): Location, additional experience, schedule preferences. Calculate match percentage based on weighted criteria. Create a sorting mechanism for candidates based on match percentage. Implement the matching engine as a separate service that can be called via API. Store match results in Supabase for quick retrieval.

Security Considerations:
- Implement proper access controls for the matching API
- Create audit logs for all matching operations
- Ensure candidate data is properly protected during the matching process
- Implement rate limiting for the matching API
- Follow the security guidelines from task 11 for handling sensitive candidate data
- Ensure matching results are only accessible to authorized recruiters

# Test Strategy:
Create test cases with various jobseeker profiles and positions to validate matching accuracy. Verify the weighting system works as expected. Test edge cases with partial matches. Benchmark performance with large datasets. Validate the sorting mechanism correctly orders candidates by match percentage. Test access controls to verify only authorized users can access matching results. Verify audit logs are created for all matching operations. Test for security vulnerabilities in the matching API. Validate that candidate data is properly protected throughout the matching process.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and implement core matching algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundation of the matching algorithm that evaluates jobseekers against positions using weighted primary and secondary criteria.
### Details:
Implement a function that takes candidate data and job requirements as input and calculates a match percentage. Primary criteria (70% weight): License type, experience level, availability. Secondary criteria (30% weight): Location, additional experience, schedule preferences. The algorithm should normalize scores within each criteria group, apply appropriate weights, and output a final percentage match score. Include unit tests to verify the algorithm works correctly with various input scenarios.

## 2. Develop candidate sorting and filtering mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create a system to sort and filter candidates based on match percentage and other relevant criteria.
### Details:
Build upon the core matching algorithm to implement sorting functionality that ranks candidates by match percentage. Add filtering capabilities to allow refinement of results based on specific criteria (e.g., minimum match percentage, specific experience, location radius). Implement pagination for large result sets. Ensure the sorting mechanism can handle ties appropriately with configurable secondary sorting criteria. Include performance optimizations for handling large candidate pools.

## 3. Create secure matching service API [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Develop a standalone service with API endpoints for the matching functionality with proper security controls.
### Details:
Implement a RESTful API service that exposes the matching algorithm. Create endpoints for: submitting match requests, retrieving match results, and managing matching criteria. Implement authentication using JWT tokens, role-based access control to restrict access to authorized users only, and input validation to prevent injection attacks. Add rate limiting to prevent abuse (e.g., max 100 requests per minute per user). Implement proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages that don't leak sensitive information.

## 4. Implement data protection and privacy controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Ensure all candidate data is properly protected during the matching process with appropriate privacy measures.
### Details:
Implement data minimization by only processing necessary candidate information for matching. Add data masking for sensitive fields when not needed for matching. Implement encryption for data in transit (HTTPS) and at rest (encrypted database fields). Create a privacy-preserving mechanism that allows initial matching without revealing full candidate details until explicitly requested by authorized recruiters. Add consent tracking to ensure candidates have opted in to matching. Implement data retention policies to automatically remove old match results after a configurable period.

## 5. Develop audit logging and Supabase integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Create comprehensive audit logging for all matching operations and integrate with Supabase for result storage.
### Details:
Implement detailed audit logging that records all matching operations including: who initiated the match, when it occurred, what criteria were used, how many candidates were processed, and which candidates were viewed. Store logs in a tamper-evident format. Create a Supabase integration to store match results with appropriate table design for efficient retrieval. Implement a caching layer to improve performance for frequently accessed match results. Add a scheduled job to clean up old match results according to retention policies. Create admin dashboard components to view audit logs and monitor system usage.
