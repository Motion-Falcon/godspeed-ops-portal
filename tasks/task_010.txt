# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Administrator Role and Management with Enhanced Security
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop the administrator functionality including recruiter management and system-wide access, with enhanced security measures appropriate for privileged access.
# Details:
Extend the existing authentication system to support the administrator role. Implement recruiter management functionality (view, create, delete recruiters). Create an admin dashboard with system-wide metrics and management tools. Add functionality to view and manage all recruiters, positions, and clients. Implement proper access controls to restrict functionality to admin users only. Ensure 2FA requirement for admin login. Use Supabase for role-based access control and data management.

Security Considerations:
- Implement strict access controls for administrator functions
- Create comprehensive audit logs for all administrative actions
- Enforce strong password policies for admin accounts
- Implement IP-based restrictions for admin access
- Add session timeout for admin sessions (shorter than regular users)
- Follow the security guidelines from task 11 for handling administrative access
- Implement alerts for suspicious admin activities
- Ensure proper separation of duties for administrative functions

# Test Strategy:
Test role-based access control to ensure only admins can access restricted functionality. Verify recruiter management operations (view, create, delete). Test the admin dashboard with various data scenarios. Validate that 2FA is properly enforced for admin login. Ensure all admin actions are properly logged for audit purposes. Test access controls to verify only authorized administrators can access specific functions. Verify audit logs are created for all administrative actions. Test password policies for admin accounts. Validate IP-based restrictions for admin access. Test session timeout for admin sessions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Extend Authentication System for Administrator Role with Enhanced Security [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the existing authentication system to support the administrator role with enhanced security measures including 2FA, strong password policies, and IP restrictions.
### Details:
Update Supabase authentication to include an 'admin' role. Implement 2FA requirement for admin accounts using a library like 'otplib'. Create middleware to verify admin role for protected routes. Add IP-based access restrictions by storing allowed IP addresses in the database and checking incoming requests. Implement password policy enforcement requiring minimum 12 characters, special characters, numbers, and regular rotation. Configure shorter session timeouts (30 minutes) for admin users compared to regular users.

## 2. Implement Comprehensive Audit Logging System for Administrative Actions [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create a robust audit logging system that records all administrative actions with detailed information for security monitoring and compliance.
### Details:
Design and implement an audit log database table with fields for timestamp, admin user, IP address, action type, affected resources, and before/after states. Create middleware to automatically log all administrative API calls. Implement a service to record sensitive operations with detailed context. Add functionality to detect and alert on suspicious patterns (multiple failed logins, unusual access times, bulk operations). Ensure logs cannot be modified or deleted, even by administrators. Create an admin-accessible interface to view and filter audit logs.

## 3. Develop Recruiter Management Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Create the interface and backend functionality for administrators to view, create, edit, and delete recruiter accounts with proper access controls.
### Details:
Implement API endpoints for CRUD operations on recruiter accounts with admin-only access. Create UI components for listing recruiters with filtering and sorting capabilities. Develop forms for creating and editing recruiter details with validation. Implement confirmation workflows for sensitive operations like account deletion. Add functionality to temporarily suspend recruiter accounts. Ensure all actions are properly logged through the audit system. Apply the principle of least privilege by limiting what data is accessible and what operations can be performed.

## 4. Build Admin Dashboard with System-wide Metrics and Management Tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Create a comprehensive dashboard for administrators with system-wide metrics, alerts, and management tools for positions and clients.
### Details:
Design and implement a dashboard UI with key metrics (active recruiters, open positions, client engagement, system usage). Create data visualization components for trends and patterns. Implement real-time alerts for critical events. Add management interfaces for viewing and managing all positions and clients in the system. Include bulk operations capabilities with appropriate safeguards. Create a system status section showing current configuration and security status. Ensure all components respect access control restrictions and log actions appropriately.

## 5. Implement Separation of Duties and Security Alerting System [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Establish separation of duties for administrative functions and implement a security alerting system for suspicious activities.
### Details:
Design and implement different admin privilege levels (e.g., user admin, system admin, security admin) to enforce separation of duties. Create approval workflows for highly sensitive operations requiring multiple admin approvals. Implement real-time alerting for suspicious activities via email, SMS, or in-app notifications. Add functionality to automatically lock accounts after suspicious activities. Create a security dashboard showing recent alerts and potential issues. Implement regular security reports summarizing administrative activities and potential concerns. Test the entire system with security-focused scenarios to verify proper implementation of all security measures.
